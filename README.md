1 ) Fraud Detection in Credit Card Transactions using ML Techniques 
    - In this project we have build different machine learning models and compared them to check which model gives the best resultcto classify or identify fraudulent card 
    - transactions from a given card transactions data.
    - 
    Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud
    Problem statement: Credit Card fraud Detection
    Type of problem: Classification, Supervised
    Data type: PCA transformed numerical variables
    Performance Measures: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Confusion Matrix
    Feature Importance: Not required

    Used the following classification models.

    Logistic Regression
    KNN
    Decision Tree
    Random forest
    XGBoost

2) Machine Learning using MNIST Dataset

    Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data
    Problem statement: Handwritten digit recognization (0-9)
    Type of problem: Classification, Supervised
    Data type: Images stored in csv file
    Performance Measures: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Confusion Matrix
    Feature Importance: Not required
    Interpretability: We can provide nearest neighbors of the query image to justify why image is classified as 'this'

        Classification Algorithms used in MNIST dataset:

        K-Nearest Neighbor
        Logistic Regression (one-vs-rest)
        SVM Classifier
        Decision Tree
        Random Forest
        XGBoost
